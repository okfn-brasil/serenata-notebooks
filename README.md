# Notebooks from [Operação Serenata de Amor](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/serenata-de-amor)

## What

[Operação Serenata de Amor](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/serenata-de-amor) has been acknowledged as a great AI project in Brazil and other countries. It has become not only a project to audit public expenses but also a space of sharing and collaboration. During its history, Serenata has had many people devoted to exploring its datasets through experimental notebooks which could possibly become a [Rosie](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/serenata-de-amor/blob/master/rosie/README.md)'s classifier.

These notebooks from multiple authors are rich assets from which people can learn about data science, Python third-party libraries and core functions, as well as gather ideas for their own investigations.

Notebooks have been removed from the main repo, but with this exploratory and educative mindset, the team republishes the notebooks in this repo, also re-opening the space for collaboration and learning. Make yourself at home, you can read notebooks and share your own.
